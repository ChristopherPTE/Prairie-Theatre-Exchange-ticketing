 If your ticket purchase includes seating designated as accessible (generally set aside for patrons under the Americans with Disabilities Act), you may be greeted by ushers near the seating area.  If it is more appropriate to seat you elsewhere for any reason, you explicitly accept that you and your entire party may be reseated at the sole discretion of the venue into seats of our choosing and subject to availability on that performance.
