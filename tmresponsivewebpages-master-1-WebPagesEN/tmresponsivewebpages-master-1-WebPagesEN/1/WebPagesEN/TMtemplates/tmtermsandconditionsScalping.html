 We do not make tickets available to scalpers or the secondary market.  We reserve the right to cancel your ticket purchase at any time and for any reason if we determine that there is a potential issue with your order or a risk to the venue (including but not limited to financial, reputation or any other reason).   Tickets cancelled by the venue more than 7 days prior to the performance will receive a full refund for the tickets.
